# Cellular Automaton Simulation:
# Conway's Game of Life (see: Wikipedia entry)
# Goals of the program:
# 1. allows editing of initial configurations of CGL
#     2. allows viewing and saving of initial seed
#     3. allows simulation of CGL based on initial seed
#     4. allows saving of each iteration as an image file (BMP?)
